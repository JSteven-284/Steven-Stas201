Conversational AI Agents like chatbots and voice assistants have proliferated due to two main developments. On one hand the methods required to develop highly accurate AI models i.e. Machine Learning, Deep Learning have seen a tremendous amount of advancement due to the increasing research interest in these fields accompanied by the progress in achieving higher computing power with the help of complex hardware architectures like GPUs and TPUs. Secondly, due to the Natural Language interface and the nature of their design, conversational agents have been seen as a natural fit in a wide array of applications like healthcare, customer care, ecommerce and education. This rise in the practical implementation and their demand has in turn made Conversational AI a ripe area for innovation and novel research. Newer and more complex models for the individual core components of a Conversational AI architecture are being introduced at a never before seen rate. This study is intended to shed light on such latest research in Conversational AI architecture development and also to highlight the improvements that these novel innovations have achieved over their traditional counterparts. This paper also provides a comprehensive account of some of the research opportunities in the Conversational AI domain and thus setting up the stage for future research and innovation in this field."

Recent existing reviews have focused exclusively on a subset of embodied conversational agent interventions despite other modalities aiming to achieve the common goal of improved mental health. This study aimed to review the use of conversational agent interventions in the treatment of mental health problems. We performed a systematic search using relevant databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane library). Studies that reported on an autonomous conversational agent that simulated conversation and reported on a mental health outcome were included. A total of 13 studies were included in the review. Among them, 4 full-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The rest were feasibility, pilot RCTs and quasi-experimental studies. Interventions were diverse in design and targeted a range of mental health problems using a wide variety of therapeutic orientations. All included studies reported reductions in psychological distress postintervention. Furthermore, 5 controlled studies demonstrated significant reductions in psychological distress compared with inactive control groups. In addition, 3 controlled studies comparing interventions with active control groups failed to demonstrate superior effects. Broader utility in promoting well-being in nonclinical populations was unclear. The efficacy and acceptability of conversational agent interventions for mental health problems are promising. However, a more robust experimental design is required to demonstrate efficacy and efficiency. A focus on streamlining interventions, demonstrating equivalence to other treatment modalities, and elucidating mechanisms of action has the potential to increase acceptance by users and clinicians and maximize reach."

It features distributed modules called experts each of which is specialized to perform certain kinds of tasks. A common interface that all experts must support is specified, and any kind of expert can be incorporated if it has the interface. Several modules running in parallel coordinate the experts by accessing them through the interface, so that the whole system can achieve flexible control, such as interruption handling and parallel task execution."
